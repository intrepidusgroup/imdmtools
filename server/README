Here's a very simple, bare-bones, works-enough-to-test-and-play server for 
iOS Mobile Device Management.

This file outlines some of the steps to set it up. Additional documentation,
and explanation of the protocol itself, is located in the Black Hat 
whitepaper elsewhere in this repository.

                                    Setup
 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. Get an APNS certificate

Used to be you needed to be in the enterprise developer program to get this.
Now I believe you can acquire one through the normal iOS dev program, or 
you can install Lion Server and get one through there. 

Once you have the certificate, you need to convert it to a plain .PEM file 
containing the certificate and private key. To avoid having to type the
private key password every time you send a message to the device, you'll need
to remove the passphrase as well. (obviously, you need to protect the key
extra-special after that.)

When I did this on my Mac, here's what I did (your mileage may vary, esp.
if you're not doing this on a Mac):

  1. Locate the certificate in Keychain Access
  2. Export to a .p12 file
  3. Convert to .pem 
    "openssl pkcs12 -in OrigPushCert.p12 -out PushCert.pem"
  4. Strip the passphrase
    "openssl rsa -in PushCert.pem -out PushKeyNoPass.pem"
  5. Open PushCert.pem in a text editor
  6. Replace the encrypted "RSA Private Key" section with contents
     of PushKeyNoPass.pem
  7. Save it out

This should give you a "PushCert.pem" file containing the APNS certificate and 
private key, with no passphrase. Again, exercise appropriate precautions to
ensure this doesn't get posted on the web somewhere.

                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

2. Create server and identity certificates

If you have a valid, signed certificate you can use, use it. Simpler that way.

Otherwise, we'll have to create a CA, use it to sign a server certificate, and
install that CA cert onto the device you want to test wtih.

Change into the certs folder, and run the "make_certs.sh" script.

This will:

  1. Create a new CA. For Common Name, call it something like "MDM Test CA."

  2. Create a server certificate and key. For Common Name, you need to use
     the name of the server as it will appear in the MDM profile. If you use
     a DNS-resolvable name, that goes here. If you're going to just use the
     IP address, that goes here. (like '192.168.1.1')

  3. Create an identity certificate and key, and save it to a .p12 file. 
     You'll need to give the .p12 an export password. Include this .p12 
     and the password in the "Credentials" payload for the IPCU profile you'll
     create below, then select the Identity payload in the MDM payload.
 
  4. Finally, it'll copy everything back up a folder next to the server.py
     script.

There's a fair amount of voodoo in all this, hopefully it'll work fine for you.
If it doesn't, Google Early and Often.

                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

3. Create an MDM enrollment profile

You'll need the iPhone Configuration Utility (IPCU), a free download from
Apple. Launch that, and create a new profile. You'll have to first enter
some generic information in the "General" payload, then go to the MDM payload
and create a new entry:

  * For the Server field, enter the URL for your server
    (ex: https://192.168.1.1:8080/server)
  * For the Check In field, do the same (but change to /checkin)
    (ex: https://192.168.1.1:8080/checkin)
  * The Topic field needs the be the User ID listed in Subject Name section
    of the APNS push certificate
    (ex: com.apple.mgmt.XServer.d74790cb-66a3-48bc-9d02-945d91500db9)
  * Leave the rest as default (check all the things you want to manage, etc.)

Finally, you'll need to add an Identity certificate in the Certificates 
payload section. This can be an end-user cert created above (alongside the
server cert), or something else from a CA chain that'll be trusted by the
device. If you used the script in step 2, then add the "Identity.p12" file
you created. You'll want to enter the passphrase you created for the .p12 
file into the Certificate payload, otherwise you'll have to enter it on the
device every time you re-enroll. (and you may be re-enrolling a lot. :) )

Save this configuration. In IPCU, go to File -> Export, select "none" for
security (no signing, no encryption), then Next, and give it a filename.
Copy the file to the server folder as "Enroll.mobileconfig." 

Now, it gets tricky.  The latest version of IPCU (3.4) does NOT include the 
proper settings for installing and managing applications. So you need to:

  * Edit the Enroll.mobileconfig file (in your favorite appropriate editor)
  * Find the "AccessRights" key (probably near the top of PayloadConent)
  * Change the value from 2047 (default for all rights) to 8191 (all for iOS5)
  * Save it and exit

                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

4. Install the CA cert to the device

If you're using self-signed server and identity certificates, then the device
will need to have the certificate for the self-signed CA installed, otherwise
it won't trust the connection to the server.

The easiest way to do this is by launching the server, and on the device,
surfing in Mobile Safari to:

    https://<server-ip>:8080/ca

If Safari refuses access to this server because it's untrusted (this'll depend
on device settings -- it might just warn you), then you should edit the server
code and comment out the CherryPy lines (importing CherryPy, and the two
loading up the certs). Then restart the server, and connect again using
just straight http (no TLS).

Don't forget to change it back, as the MDM service requires TLS as of iOS 5.


                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

5. Enroll the device in MDM

On the device, surf in Mobile Safari to: 

    https://<server-ip>:8080/enroll

and the MDM enrollment profile should be downloaded and installed. Once you've
agreed to all the appropriate dialogs, open up the server in a window on
your desktop (https://<server-ip>:8080/) and select a command from the
drop-down. "Device Information" is a good one to test, as is "DeviceLock."

If those work, you're good to do. Messages (in and out) should be written
to xactn.log, and credentials (for push notification and remote passcode
clearing) will be stored in creds.py. Protect both of those files, as they
contain sensitive information (like the unlock token, which is a keybag that
will allow you to unlock the device).

                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

6. Experiment, and enjoy!

That's it. Or, hopefully, it will be. :) 

Again, this is a very simple, bare-bones, virtually-no-error-handling kind of
experimental server. So don't expect it to be perfect. But hopefully it'll be
enough for you to begin experimenting with MDM, so you can better understand
how it works and what limitations (and features) it may have.

If you want to try installing different profiles, just build them in IPCU,
export them to a .mobileconfig file, and copy that over the provided 
Example.mobileconfig file. Then the "Install Profile" command will send that
new profile to the testing device.

Thanks for playing!
