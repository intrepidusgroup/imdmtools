## transaction log
## this will get filled up with timestamped JSON strings showing commands
##    issued by the server, and requests/responses from the client.
## 
## Be careful, this will likely include sensitive information, like
##   * Device Tokens
##   * Devie Unlock Tokens
##   * Push Certificate Topic (not super sensitive, but still)
##   * Device information (UDID, phone numbers, blah blah blah)
##
## So if you want to send this to anyone, SCRUB IT FIRST
